🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Nakarin Kungvalchokchai, a former Senior Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience in enterprise banking systems, recently graduated with an MSc in Data Science & Its Applications from the University of Essex.

I’m transitioning from backend engineering and cloud architecture to the dynamic world of data science and analytics, where I combine my software expertise with machine learning, data engineering, and statistical modeling to deliver actionable business insights.

I’m passionate about applying data-driven solutions to complex problems in finance, banking, and technology, using tools that bridge data, AI, and decision-making.
